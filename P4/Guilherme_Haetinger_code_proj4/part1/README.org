This module will reproduce the results of my report web page. To use it, just change the code in the following way:

To train, change the boolean variable in =line 10=. If you don't have a GPU available to run the newest version of PyTorch, set this variable to True, because my saved CNN is based on CUDA, meaning it can't be serialized without a GPU (for some reason). The training will write on a file called "./new_cloth_net.pth", which you can, then set as input in =line 149= if you want to test out its result after the first iteration.

At the end of the code, there are three executions of the code in my images. You can copy the code and input a few images of your own. Just remember, they must be one channeled and 28x28.
